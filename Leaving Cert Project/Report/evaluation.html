          <h1>Evaluation</h1>

		  <h2><u>Heuristic Evaluation - Nielsen Heuristics</u></h2>
		  <br>
		  <p><b>1. Visibility of System Status</b></p>
		  <p>
		  The game provides feedback on whether or not the user gives the correct answer. If the user answers incorrectly, the game creates a graph and informs the user that their
		  answer was incorrect.
		  </p>
		  <p><b>2. Match Between System and the Real World</b></p>
		  <p>The game uses a small sprite of Donald Trump as the player to bring a degree of familiarity to the table. Following convention, the country choices are oriented along the x 
		  and y axis. 
		  
		  <p><b>3. User Control and Freedom</b></p>
		  <p>
		  The user, using the WASD or arrow key control scheme, has full freedom of movement in two dimensions. The user has an infinite number of chances to give the correct answer.
		  </p>
		  <p><b>4. Consistency of Standard</b></p>
		  <p>
		  The user can use the WASD control scheme to control the player. This is standard in the gaming industry.
		  </p>
		  <p><b>5. Error Prevention</b></p>
		  <p>
		  Error-prone conditions in the game were removed by limiting the area the user could move around. This was achieved using x and y coordinate checks on the user's position.
		  </p>
		  <p><b>6. Recognition Rather Than Recall</b></p>
		  <p>
		  The framework of the quiz is the same for each question. If the user can answer one question, they will have learned how to answer them all. Instructions on how to navigate
		  around the website are clear and concise.
		  <p><b>7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use</b></p>
		  <p>
		  The minimalistic design caters to both experienced and inexperienced users. While there are no accelerators due to time constraints, the design is easy to understand and intuitive to navigate.
		  </p>
		  <p><b>8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</b></p>
		  <p>
		  The design is simple - it consists of a question, four possible answers and a player. It is pleasing to the eye, and the use of the Garamond font in the heading of the page brings an air of tranquility to the page.
		  </p>
		  <br><br>
		  		
		  <h4><b>Review of the Artefact</b></h4>
		  <p>
		  Overall, the artefact proved to be an overwhelming success. The artefact successfully fulfilled the conditions specified by the brief, and added an original and interactive spin to the traditional project.
